# Therapy contract-payment platform

A contract-payment verification platform for outpatient therapy practices and their billing firms. It ingests copies of 835 remittances and payer contracts, computes expected payment per service line under approved contract versions, groups shortfalls by payer pattern into dispute packets a person approves, and proves recovery by reconciling later remittances to payment posting and deposits.

The build specification is in [docs/product/PRD.md](docs/product/PRD.md), with its reference tabs: [data dictionary](docs/product/data-dictionary.md), [rules reference](docs/product/rules-reference.md), [test matrix](docs/product/test-matrix.md) and the [milestone prompts](docs/product/milestone-prompts.md).

No real PHI, real 835, real contract or real export ever enters this repository.

## Development

Prerequisites: Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`; Node 22 or later works), pnpm 10.28 (`corepack enable` or
`npm install --global pnpm@10.28.0`), and Docker for `pnpm dev`. Nothing in the test suites needs Docker:
database tests use `DATABASE_URL`, defaulting to the docker-compose Postgres at
`postgres://postgres:test@localhost:5432/postgres`.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm lint:logs
pnpm test            # unit and property tests, with the 100% branch gates
pnpm test:db         # database tests (each creates and drops its own database)
pnpm test:e2e        # builds the web app and runs the Playwright smoke test
pnpm build           # web (Next.js standalone) and worker (esbuild bundle)
pnpm dev             # Postgres and MinIO in Docker, then the web app and the worker
```
