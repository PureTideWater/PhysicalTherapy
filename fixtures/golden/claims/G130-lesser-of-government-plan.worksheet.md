# Worksheet G130: The payer's government plan has no agreement

Computed by the independent worksheet tools/golden-worksheet (Python, exact decimal arithmetic; no code shared with packages/pricing).
Specialist verified: no. A reimbursement specialist checks every figure here before milestones 5 and 7 close.
Every reference value comes from SYNTHETIC release 900003: invented for tests, never a CMS value.

## Inputs

- Release 900003 at fixtures/synthetic/rules/release-synth-900003; its MANIFEST.json has SHA-256 e4d7228d5344d9fc824b223ae7d1af7608c81a2c9ec9fc31db1e66f1e555f5c8 and every file matched it.
- Practice settings: ZIP 00011; default rounding HALF_UP_CENT.
- Place-of-service settings (SYNTHETIC test assumption; fixtures/golden/QUESTIONS.md): 11 non-facility; 22 facility.
- Claim SYNTH-CLAIM-G130: status 1 (processed as primary); reversed by a later claim: no; superseded by a correction: no; payer and plan SYNTH-PAYER-B/PLAN-GOV.
- Remittance date: 2026-03-26; dispute windows are judged on the triage date 2026-10-15.
- Mapping map-b-gov: government, 2026-01-01 to open.
- Contract version cv-b-1 (contract contract-synth-b, version 1, signed_off, 2026-01-01 to open; windows: timely filing 365 days, dispute not stated, appeal levels none stated):
  - Rate record rr-b-fixed: LESSER_OF the line charge and the schedule (FIXED_SCHEDULE, 3400 cents ($34.00) per unit); scope codes 97110, 97112, 97116, 97140; any modifiers; any place of service; 2026-01-01 to open; flags apply_mppr off, apply_assistant_reduction off, apply_sequestration on, apply_ncci off; timed_units_rule MEDICARE_POOLED; rounding HALF_EVEN_CENT; contract-specific adjustment pays 98% of the amount.
  - Rate record rr-b-medicare: LESSER_OF the line charge and the schedule (PERCENT_OF_MEDICARE at 125%, year basis CURRENT, locality basis practice, conversion factor non_qualifying_apm); scope codes 97530, 97161, 97162, 97163, 97164, 97026, 97035, G0283, 97750; any modifiers; any place of service; 2026-01-01 to open; flags apply_mppr off, apply_assistant_reduction on, apply_sequestration off, apply_ncci on; timed_units_rule PER_CODE; rounding TRUNCATE; contract-specific adjustment none.

| Line | Code | Modifiers | Units | Service date | POS | Charge (cents) | Observed allowed (cents) | PR adjustments (cents) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 97110 | GP | 1 | 2026-03-05 | 11 | 5000 | 2500 (amt_b6) | none |

## Steps 1 to 3, per line

### Line 1: 97110 x 1 on 2026-03-05

Step 1, the agreement.
- Mapping map-b-gov (government, 2026-01-01 to open) is in force on 2026-03-05.
- **Unpriced: `NO_AGREEMENT`.** The plan is mapped as government: no agreement governs the line.

## Results

| Line | Outcome | Expected allowed (cents) | Unrounded (cents) | Rounding | Patient share (cents) | Variance (cents) | Dispute window | Review flags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | unpriced `NO_AGREEMENT` | | | | | | | |
