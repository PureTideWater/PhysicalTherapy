ACTING (Lane A's account, https://claude.ai/code/session_019i9ifAfByN2caCea4jgSdu) holds this item from 2026-11-05T04:10Z, assigned by Lane A's orchestrator (session_01TrKDxeLbxVo7t7zwRXFzrg), the last item of the queue after brand-settle (#121, merged).

# Item: the branded code email and the "password changed" email (`co-001/auth-emails`), one UX item

The sources: designs/lane-b-ux-sign-in-recovery.md, section 2.5 (the proposed words) and the handoffs "Lane A or the
founder" (a worker job carrying `user_id` only); approval-summaries/lane-b-ux-sign-in-recovery-status.md; lanes/lane-b.md:1455.
- Cognito's code email is unbranded today (infra/lib/constructs/identity.ts). Unless a CustomMessage trigger is set, the
  forgot-password email shares the pool's verification template.
- There is no "your password was changed" email.
#42 (mail streams) merged 2026-11-02, so its files are on the base; there is no overlap to wait on.
Reviews: auth and email, so two reviews with skeptics, security and UX/brand, then CI and the merge.
GITLEAKS RULE: an agent that meets a gitleaks refusal rewrites the flagged text and never touches .gitleaksignore.

## Log (UTC)
- 2026-11-05T04:10Z: started. Worktree /home/user/auth-emails from f185655c (#121). A workflow runs design, build,
  Workflow wf_a7821f86-a18; script archived as workflow-scripts/lane-a-auth-emails.js.
  two reviews with skeptics, one fix round with the full suite, and verification.

- 2026-11-05T04:12Z: the orchestrator's scope (04:03Z) was put into the script.
  - A CustomMessage trigger for every code email: text-first, no remote assets, no link carrying a code or an
    address.
  - "Password changed" goes through #42's transactional stream and outbox, with a support route and an audit by ID.
  - Read first: ADR 0065, deliverability.md, ADR 0081 and 0088.
  - Counters: ADR 0091 or an amendment; SGN-13 to SGN-16.
  - Reviews: security (takeover, enumeration, phishing look-alikes), then UX and brand with light and dark client shots.
  The first run (wf_a7821f86-a18, before the scope) was stopped before writing anything. It was relaunched as
  wf_a29a90cd-d6b.

## Waiting on someone
- None.
