# Therapy contract-payment platform

A contract-payment verification platform for outpatient therapy practices and their billing firms. It ingests copies of 835 remittances and payer contracts, computes expected payment per service line under approved contract versions, groups shortfalls by payer pattern into dispute packets a person approves, and proves recovery by reconciling later remittances to payment posting and deposits.

The build specification is in [docs/product/PRD.md](docs/product/PRD.md), with its reference tabs: [data dictionary](docs/product/data-dictionary.md), [rules reference](docs/product/rules-reference.md), [test matrix](docs/product/test-matrix.md) and the [milestone prompts](docs/product/milestone-prompts.md).

No real PHI, real 835, real contract or real export ever enters this repository.
