# Worksheet G43: MA non-contracted, a code with no relative value

Computed by the independent worksheet tools/golden-worksheet (Python, exact decimal arithmetic; no code shared with packages/pricing).
Specialist verified: no. A reimbursement specialist checks every figure here before milestones 5 and 7 close.
Every reference value comes from SYNTHETIC release 900001: invented for tests, never a CMS value.

## Inputs

- Release 900001 at fixtures/synthetic/rules/release-synth-900001; its MANIFEST.json has SHA-256 6d346c8fa596c0f720ff3176be10044e86c9b4fe843d37b04c59192cdbdce45a and every file matched it.
- Practice settings: ZIP 00011; default rounding HALF_UP_CENT.
- Place-of-service settings (SYNTHETIC test assumption; fixtures/golden/QUESTIONS.md): 11 non-facility; 22 facility.
- Claim SYNTH-CLAIM-G43: status 1 (processed as primary); reversed by a later claim: no; superseded by a correction: no; payer and plan SYNTH-MA-PLAN-1.
- Remittance date: not known; dispute windows are judged on the triage date 2026-10-15.
- Mapping map-ma-1: ma_noncontracted, 2026-01-01 to open.
- Contract versions: none.

| Line | Code | Modifiers | Units | Service date | POS | Charge (cents) | Observed allowed (cents) | PR adjustments (cents) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 97750 | GP | 1 | 2026-03-10 | 11 | 8000 | 3000 (amt_b6) | none |

## Steps 1 to 3, per line

### Line 1: 97750 x 1 on 2026-03-10

Step 1, the agreement.
- Mapping map-ma-1 (ma_noncontracted, 2026-01-01 to open) is in force on 2026-03-10.
- Medicare Advantage, non-contracted: priced as Original Medicare would, method PERCENT_OF_MEDICARE at 100%, year basis CURRENT, conversion factor non_qualifying_apm (the rules reference's default), every Medicare adjustment on (apply_mppr on, apply_assistant_reduction on, apply_sequestration on, apply_ncci on; timed_units_rule MEDICARE_POOLED); no contract rounding, so the practice default applies; no contract-specific adjustment.

Step 2, the base amount by method.
- Year basis CURRENT: the fee schedule in effect on the date of service, 2026-03-10 (basis year 2026); each value is the record in force on that date.
- **Unpriced: `NO_PFS_VALUE`.** Release 900001 has no relative value (pfs_rvu) for 97750 in 2026.

## Results

| Line | Outcome | Expected allowed (cents) | Unrounded (cents) | Rounding | Patient share (cents) | Variance (cents) | Dispute window | Review flags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | unpriced `NO_PFS_VALUE` | | | | | | | |
