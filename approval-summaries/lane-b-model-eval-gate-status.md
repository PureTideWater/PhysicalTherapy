# Lane B: model-eval-gate (#84, #120; LANES queue item 12): status

Session: the parallel Lane B session started by the orchestrator (session_01CntuGR3wkXMF6kK3at6bGh) on the co-founder's direction of 2026-10-25 ~23:40 UTC. Reserved: ADR 0070; test-matrix MOD-7 to MOD-12; `packages/synth` cases MOD-7 to MOD-12.

## Open questions
None. The co-founder's standing ruling of 2026-10-26 ~00:20 UTC (relayed by the orchestrator): "Don't ask for approvals anymore just build and optimize." Every choice takes the recommended option (security: the safer one), recorded with its reasons here and in the design and PR description. Founder-kept matters stay out of scope; Lane B still opens no migration PR (LANES rule 2).

## Stage
- 2026-10-25 23:40 UTC: machine set up (`tools/setup-container.sh` printed OK; `gh api user` is PureTideWater).
- 2026-10-25 23:55 UTC: read LANES.md, lane-b.md, CLAUDE.md, reconciliation-001's checks, audit #84 and #120. #42's files: none of this item's (only the shared test-matrix and synth registry, rule 6).
- 2026-10-26 ~00:00 UTC: **Design** in progress: `designs/lane-b-model-eval-gate.md`, one adversarial reviewer (workflow).

- 2026-10-26 00:22 UTC: design scouts done (`designs/lane-b-model-eval-gate/scout-*.md`); author drafting. The PHI scout found that an exact member-ID and patient-control-number check needs decrypting every identifier the practice holds per proposal (no lookup hash), and that a document's kind cannot be corrected after upload: both better fixed by a migration, which goes to Lane A as a proposal.

## Next step
Design reviewed, then the builders in `/home/user/model-eval-gate` on `co-001/model-eval-gate` from the latest `claude/build-platform` (6ddd587 at start).
