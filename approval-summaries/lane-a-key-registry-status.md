# Status: Queues item 37, the key registry (Lane A)

## RESUME-BLOCK (2026-11-12, W32, session_019i9ifC7PLenwLnTRu7ZVhZ; handed over at about 240k tokens)

- **Brief:** build item 37 from the note; the orchestrator's brief of 2026-11-12 06:20 UTC (steps 1 to 7) stands for
  the successor. Rulings: Q1 yes, Q3 yes; Q2 is the founder's. No PR until the orchestrator says #156 has merged.
- **The note:** `designs/lane-a-key-registry.md` **v3** (build-ops 83be44b6 or later). **Section 16 rules** where it
  differs from sections 2 to 14: one live key an account; registration after a removal closed until opened with a
  one-time code; a code session of a closed account refused in Postgres; the target of an open request changes no
  internal membership; the acting session as an argument (`actor_key_session`); the outbox's late and given-up arms.
- **Step 1, done:** `reviews/lane-a-key-registry-review-delta1.md` (R1 to R11; two blocking, both taken; it ran no
  SQL). Every finding verified and placed in section 16's table. No second round on the note. To the queue from it: a
  backup key from inside a session; an operator retry of a given-up sign-out; a second person for End membership in
  the internal organization; seven days measured on the person's key, not the membership row.
- **Step 2, half done. WIP `co-001/wip-key-registry` c0c43f2d** (base 93e137f9), two files, failing first (26 tests,
  each because the objects do not exist; type-check and lint clean):
  - `packages/db/src/key-registry.db.test.ts`: SEC-25, SEC-26, SEC-27, SGN-20, SGN-23, SGN-24, SGN-25, SGN-27.
  - `packages/db/src/provider-sign-out.db.test.ts`: JOB-06, JOB-07, SGN-19's database rows.
  They fix the names the migration must use: the function signatures (SEC-25's table, including the three helpers
  `account_removes_keys(uuid)`, `actor_key_session(uuid)`, `account_key_registration_closed(uuid)` and the two
  finality functions `hardware_key_is_final()` and `hardware_key_removal_is_final()`), and every constraint name.
  They were never run against a migration: expect to adjust details (for example `wait_minutes` after a claim).
- **BLOCKED: the migration.** `/new-migration` cannot be run by a session (the skill is for a person's typed command
  only; the hook refuses any write under `packages/db/migrations` without its marker). Told to the orchestrator
  2026-11-12. It needs the co-founder to type `/new-migration key_registry` in the building session, or their word
  there. No migration file, marker or draft SQL exists anywhere. Nobody routes around it.
- **Not started:** the rest of step 2's tests (SEC-25's lists in `catalog`, `cross-tenant`, `migrate.db.test.ts` and
  `hardening.db.test.ts`; SGN-21, SGN-22, SGN-26 and the flow's SGN-19 and SGN-27 in `sign-in.db.test.ts`; the
  notice's five functions; JOB-08; the migration tests); steps 3 to 7 entire (handlers, the four console routes, the
  flow's own assertion check and the code screen, the worker's two jobs and adapter, the measurements, the domain
  model, the two build reviews, ADR 0095, the test-matrix rows, the runbooks, the PR description).
- **What does not need the migration, for the successor to start on:** `sign-in.ts` plumbing (the challenge sealed at
  `beginKey`, the response passed to `authenticated()`, the app's own assertion and registration verification, the
  relying-party check), the dev provider twin's listing and deleting of credentials, the worker's sign-out adapter
  and job with fakes, the removal of `signOutAtProviderAfterCommit` and the reset's call.
- **Machine notes:** PostgreSQL 18 answers on `localhost:5433` and the `/tmp` socket, not `/var/run/postgresql`; run
  database tests with `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:test@localhost:5433/postgres pnpm -s vitest run --project db
  <file>`. The setup script moves the checkout to `claude/build-platform`: check out the WIP branch after it.
- **Numbers:** ADR 0095; SGN-20 to SGN-27; SEC-25 to SEC-27; JOB-06 to JOB-08. None released, none added.
- **For "What the founder should know" (to carry into the PR text):** a rollback leaves staff unable to sign in until
  roll-forward; staff re-register keys once at deploy, and no removal is possible until two administrators have;
  Q2 (at least three platform administrators, each seven days in the role); after a removal the member needs a
  one-time code from an administrator, by voice, to register the next key; one key an account for now.
- **W32 holds nothing else:** no PR, no open subagent, no scheduled task.
